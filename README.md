> 2. Identify key traits/features (words, entities, phrases) of job descriptions which are fraudulent in nature.
> 3. Run a contextual embedding model to identify the most similar job descriptions.
> 3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset to identify interesting insights from this dataset.
